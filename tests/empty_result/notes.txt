This test requires Guard Duty. As this is a paid service, the test is disabled.

The test can be enabled by running the following commands with a suitable profile or set of AWS credentials in play.

1. Create the Guard Duty detector

   aws guardduty create-detector --enable


2. Get the detector ID

   aws guardduty list-detectors --query='DetectorIds[0]'


3. Copy the detector ID reported into terraform.tfvars and update the expected_variables.json file to match, replacing
   0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef (unless that's your detector ID of course! ... It COULD happen!)


4. Change the RUN_TEST to true in ./test.sh


Once you've finished the testing, revert the changes above, and disable the detector using

   aws guardduty delete-detector --detector-id <detector_id>

replacing <detector_id> with the detector ID you extracted in step 2 above.
